    which the frame takes place in an animation and the form which is how the frame
    actually looks when rendered. -}

  -- | The animation is set to a specific time and its related frame.

    at which the frame takes place relative to the starting time of the animation. -}

    is relative to other frames, i.e. each time value is the difference
    in time from the last frame.

{-| Creates a signal that returns the current form in the animation when sampled from
    a specific animation. The second argument is a signal that returns the time to
    setup the animation forward when sampled. The third argument is a signal that returns
    the status of the animation, allowing you to control it. -}
